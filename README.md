Print at 0.16mm layer height in your choice of filament. Example in the above image was printed in Siryatech Grey ASA filament.<br><br>
Standard / normal supports at 30% density seem to work better than tree supports.<br><br>
Enable ironing on top surfaces for a smoother finish.<br><br>
2 layer thick (0.32mm) mouse ears have been added to the corners of the lid to assist with bed adhesion. These can be cut and sanded off after printing.<br><br>
Proxmark3 can be attached to the base with double sided tape to prevent rattling around inside the case and the lid can be attached to base with a couple small dots of super glue along the bottom edge. The case is rather thin, so if removal is needed later at any point just snip the lid off with a pair of filament nippers.
